# Picar Pilot

Welcome to PiCar Pilot. This is a tool specifically for the Sunfounder Picar, or potentially any system using the SunFounder Robot Hat or their libraries. The tool allows you to control your motors and servos via a Joystick controller, as well as stream video, and record video. The tool also comes with PiCar Train. PiCar Train allows you to import data recorded from PiCar Pilot and train a Tensorflow model, which can then be uploaded to the car and used to create an AI RC car that follows a track, similar to the popular Donkeycar project.

## How to use PiCar Pilot

PiCar Pilot needs the [SunFounder Robot Hat Library](https://github.com/sunfounder/robot-hat) and additional libraries installed on a Raspberry Pi according to their instructions [here.](https://docs.sunfounder.com/projects/picar-x/en/latest/python/python_start/what_do_we_need.html) Once installed, PiCar Pilot can be cloned saved anywhere on the Pi, and, after navigating to the folder via the command line on the Pi, it can be ran via the command:
   > python picar_pilot.py
